# Roller Madness

Roller Madness is a game made with Unity 5.3.1f1 as a project for the Introduction to Game Development course of the Michigan State University 

Just script assets are included for now in the project due github size limit. 
Audios, prefabs, mats, textures etc are not included but I can host them if someone is interested.
